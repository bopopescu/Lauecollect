"""
Remote control of the MAR CCD detector, using Michael Blum's sample remote
control server program "marccd_server_socket" with TCP port number 2222.

Usage example: ccd = marccd("marccd043.cars.aps.anl.gov:2222")

The server is started from the MarCCD software from the Remote Control
control panel with the second parameter ("Server command" or "Device Database
Server") set to "/home/marccdsource/servers/marccd_server_socket", and the third parameter
("Server Arguments" or "Personal Name") set to "2222".

The server understand the following commands:
start - Puts the CCD to integration mode, no reply
readout,0,filename - Reads out the detector, corrects the image and saves it to a file
  no reply
readout,1 - reads a new background image, no reply
get_state - reply is integer number containing 6 4-bit fields
  bits 0-3: state: 0=idle,8=busy
  bits 4-7: acquire
  bits 8-11: read
  bits 12-15: correct
  bits 16-19: write 
  bits 20-23: dezinger 
  Each filed contains a 4-bit code, with the following meaning: 
  0=idle, 1=queued, 2=executing, 4=error 
  The exception is the 'state' field, which has only 0=idle and 8=busy.
writefile,<filename>,1 - Save the last read image, no reply
set_bin,8,8 - Use 512x512-pixel bin mode, no reply
set_bin,2,2 - Use full readout mode (2048x2048 pixels), no reply
  (The 1x1 bin mode with 4096x4096 pixels is not used, because the point-spread
  function of the fiber optic taper is large compared to the pixel size)
get_bin - reply is two integer numbers, e.g. "2,2"
get_size_bkg - reply is the number of pixels of current the background image, e.g. "2048,2048"
