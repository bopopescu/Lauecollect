This directory is used by Mac OS X as an "Application Bundle".

An application bundle is needed to launch a Python program from the Finder or Dock
and to associate file extension with an application to open a file.

This directory was automatically created from a .py file using the "Build Applet"
utility coming with "MacPython". 
I edited the script in the subdirectory "Contents/MacOS" to launch the orignal
.py file, rather than the copy "Build Applet" placed in the "Contents/Resources"
subdirectory.
